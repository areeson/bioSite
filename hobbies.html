            <span>One of the biggest hobbies and passions within Mikale's life is health and fitness. For him, this looksl ike three workouts a week at 5:00 AM that last for about two hours. The goal is to maintain strength without injury now that he's not competing. He finds that the best time is early in the morning so that you can get your day started off right but also because the gym is more empty, offering a more peaceful atmosphere. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Part of the reason he has gotten into fitness at this depth is because of how long he has been going to the gym. It was football that got him in at the age of about 12 of 13 years old. While competing the goal was to increase speed, explosiveness,, and overall athletic abilities. Now as a retired athlete, there more focus on maintenance rather than getting bigger. 
                <br />
                <br />
                The other part of health that has grabbed his interest is yoga. This all started his freshman year of college because of an older football player extending an invite to their yoga session. Since then he has really taken to hot yoga and enjoys the stretching and meditation aspects. Originally this was also used for athletic abilities but is now used more so for mindfulness, focusing on a peace of mind.

            <span>Next we have Mikale's hobby of reading. This came about in sumer of 2018 when he was picking up more reading for his grad school. The pull comes from biographies and autobiographies, specifically from black people where he can study the past of his culture, as well as where it is headed. This is an activity to help him educate himself more, including extending his vocabulary. WPeaking intelligently is a skill that is always being worked on and reading is a great way to find and learn new language. </span>

            <span>Lastly we have hiking. During a road trip out to Colorado, spring break of 2017, Mikale got to hike the Garden of The Gods area. Part of the reason hiking became such a hobby for Mikale is because it is in a sense, a mix of the last two hobbies. You get out and are active while also creating a therapeutic sense. It's good for the mind and body while also being a social activity. Since then the goal has been to get at least one hike in per year.</span>
