            <p>Beyond just the professional side, Mikale enjoys himself by building great connections with those that are close to him, such as friends and family. He thinks it's always important to stay true to yourself and never minimize who you are for other people. Be authentically yourself. Lastly, he has been implementing fruits, veggies, and fasting into his life as a part of his health and recommends it to stay sharp.</p>
