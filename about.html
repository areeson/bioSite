                <span>Mikale Wilbon grew up in Dixmoor, Illinois before moving further inwards in Chicago when he hit seventh grade. He spent the rest of his middle school and high school years in Chicago before making his way to college at The University of Nebraska – Lincoln. This is where he spent the next six years, studying to get his bachelors in Sociology as well as his masters in Higher Education. During his time at UNL he also played for the Huskers, in 2017 he ran as the starting running back for 7 games. It was also during this time that he practiced and developed some of the hobbies discussed on the hobbies page. It was early in his college career that a handful of older classmates invited him to yoga. That was the step off point to a continued hobby that Mikale practices on a regular basis to this day. <br />
                    <br />
                    Within two months of graduating, Mikale landed his first job within his career path. The summer of 2020 included his move from Nebraska out to Laramie, Wyoming. An area that he never expected to be, however, it has been the foundation to his career as he’s helped advise student athletes there for nearly two years. Currently he oversees some of the football students as well as the entire track team, leading them to an all-time team best GPA of 3.47. In time, he plans on moving to Texas where he will continue to build connections and inspire those around him.
